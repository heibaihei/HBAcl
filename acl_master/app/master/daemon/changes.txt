by closing the IPC pipe, and killing service is rude by signal SIGTEM children.

1) 2017.6.18
1.1) feature: In Docker's running time, the master's pid was set to 1; When
stopping master by sending TERM singal to master's pid, master_sigdeath func
will be called and which'll send TERM to -pid that's the master's pid group,
but in docker the pid is 1, so we should stop the children in the other way.
